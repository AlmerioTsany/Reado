<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Reado (Read Book) is an android application that aims to make it easier to search, find, and find out what books are available on Google books api. This application has several features including:

* Recommended book
* Get books by category
* Book search by title, author, publisher and category
* Book details containing title, rating, maturity rating, and description
* Feature to save books into bookmarks for later use
* Notifications every day to show recommended books to read that day

Reado was made by 3 members [Reihan Fatilla](https://github.com/ReihanFatilla), [Naufal Aulia](https://github.com/auliamnaufal), and [Almerio Tsany](https://github.com/almeriotsaa) (but it is possible to collaborate). This project was created in order to work on the final project of our school, SMK IDN Boarding School Jonggol.
